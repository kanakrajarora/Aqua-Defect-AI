# AquaDefect AI

**AquaDefect AI** is an AI-powered **water tank defect detection** application built with **Streamlit** and **YOLOv8n**.  
It enables real-time detection of multiple tank defects using pre-trained custom models on a proprietary dataset.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Simple **Streamlit web interface** for defect detection.
- Supports multiple defect types in water tanks.
- Uses **YOLOv8n** models fine-tuned on a custom image dataset.
- Modular design for easy integration of new detection types.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanakrajarora/Aqua-Defect-AI.git
cd Aqua-Defect-AI
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

---

##  Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- NumPy

---

##  Model Training
The YOLOv8n models (`.pt` files) were **trained on a custom image dataset** specifically curated for water tank defect detection.  
Each defect type has its own fine-tuned model for high accuracy.
